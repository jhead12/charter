	Digital Photography Review is an independent resource dedicated to the provision of news, 
	reviews and information about Digital Photography and Digital Imaging published at the Internet 
	address www.dpreview.com. Digital Photography Review is a fully owned website of dpreview.com Limited.
</p>
<p>
	These days the site is one of, if not the, premium digital photography site with an audience of seven million unique visitors a month (around 20 million visitor sessions) reading over one hundred million pages. The site really has sky rocketed since those early days at the end of 1998. We believe in original content, unbiased content with as much detail as we can provide, we have been often copied but never bettered. We also also believe strongly that having our own material is the key to keeping the site interesting, unlike some 'para-sites' which simply reproduce other sites content.
</p>
<p>
	One of the keys to the site is its long term stickiness, users bookmark and then return regularly, over 60% of our daily visitors come from their bookmarks / typed in URL. Many thanks to all my regular visitors and welcome onboard to the new visitors.
